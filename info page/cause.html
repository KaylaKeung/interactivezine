        <h1>Cause</h1>
        The odd-eyed coloring is caused when either the epistatic (dominant)
        white gene (which masks any other color genes and turns a cat completely
        white) or the white spotting gene (which is the gene responsible for
        bicolor and tuxedo cats) prevents melanin (pigment) granules from
        reaching one eye during development, resulting in a cat with one blue
        eye and one green, yellow, or brown eye. The condition only rarely
        occurs in cats that lack both the dominant white and the white spotting
        gene.
        <h1>Kittens</h1>
        <p>As with some other newborn mammals, all cats are blue-eyed as kittens, and may change as the newborn ages.
            The differences in an odd-eyed kitten's eye color might not be noticeable, save upon close inspection.
            Odd-eyed kittens have a different shade of blue in each eye. The color of the odd eye changes over a period
            of months–for example, from blue to green to yellow or from green to blue to yellow–until it reaches its
            final, adult color.</p>
        </p>
        <h1>Cultural reactions and folklore</h1>
        <p>Odd-eyed cats are popular within several breeds, including, Van cat, Turkish Van, Turkish Angora, Sphynx, Persian, Oriental Shorthair, Japanese Bobtail and Khao Manee. In Turkey, Ankara Zoo has a breeding program to preserve pure white Turkish Angora cats with blue and amber eyes. The zoo specifically prized the odd-eyed Angoras who had one blue eye and one amber eye, as the Turkish folklore suggests that "the eyes must be as green as the lake and as blue as the sky." The mascot of the 2010 FIBA World Championship, hosted by Turkey, was an anthropomorphized odd-eyed Van Cat named "Bascat".
            Muhammad's pet Angora, Muezza, was reputed to be an odd-eyed cat. In the Japanese Bobtail, odd-eyed cats are most frequently found in calico individuals.</p>
